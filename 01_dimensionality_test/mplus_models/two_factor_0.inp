TITLE: Multilevel Two-Factor Model (No Regressions on Negative Affect);

DATA: 
  FILE = "/Users/corrado/Documents/bipolar_continuum/data/mplus_data/neff_2.dat";

VARIABLE: 
  NAMES = user_id day time_window scs_pos_1 scs_neg_2 scs_pos_3 scs_neg_4

  CLUSTER = user_id;  ! Clustering at the subject level

MISSING = .;

ANALYSIS:
  TYPE = TWOLEVEL;  ! Multilevel model with user_id as the cluster
  ESTIMATOR = ML;  ! Maximum likelihood estimation 

MODEL:
  %WITHIN%  ! Level 1: Within-subject and within-day variation
    PositiveSelfCompassion_w BY scs_pos_1 scs_pos_3 scs_pos_6 scs_pos_7;  
    ! Positive self-compassion factor on within level
    NegativeSelfCompassion_w BY scs_neg_2 scs_neg_4 scs_neg_5 scs_neg_8;
