To ensure data quality, we implemented a procedure for identifying and excluding participants exhibiting patterns of careless responding. 

### Phase 1

In a preliminary phase, we administered three questionnaires (DERS, SCS, DASS-21) to describe the sample properties. The responses were analyzed using the careless R package, which computes various indices of response quality. Specifically, we calculated the following indices: Longstring Index, Intra-Individual Response Variability (IRV), Even-Odd Inconsistency Index, and Mahalanobis Distance. 

#### Longstring Index

The Longstring index measures the longest sequence of consecutive identical responses provided by a participant during a single measurement occasion. A high Longstring index may indicate "straightlining," a response pattern often associated with careless or inattentive behavior. If the posterior estimate of the average Longstring index is credibly higher for participants with a positive UCS-CS association, it would suggest that this group exhibits a greater tendency toward careless responding.

#### Intra-Individual Response Variability

Intra-Individual Response Variability (IRV) is defined as the standard deviation of responses across a set of consecutive items for a given individual (Dunn et al., 2018). A lower IRV is often interpreted as an indicator of a greater tendency toward careless responding.

#### Even-Odd Inconsistency Index

The Even-Odd Inconsistency Index measures response inconsistency by dividing a unidimensional scale into two halves—an even-odd split—and analyzing the relationship between the two subsets of items. The procedure is as follows: 

1. **Split the scale**: Items are divided into two subsets, with even-numbered items forming one subset and odd-numbered items forming the other.  
2. **Compute subscale scores**: The average response for each subset is calculated, resulting in two scores—one for the even subscale and one for the odd subscale.  
3. **Calculate within-person correlation**: A correlation is computed between the two subscale scores for each participant, treating the even scores as variable $x$ and the odd scores as variable $y$, resulting in a correlation coefficient $r(x, y)$.  
4. **Correct for scale length**: The correlation is adjusted for the reduced length of the scale using the Spearman–Brown prophecy formula.  
5. **Compute the inconsistency score**: The final score is calculated as $0 - r(x, y)$, where higher values indicate a greater likelihood of careless responding.

For the present analysis, the Compassionate Self (CS) items were treated as odd, and the Uncompassionate Self (UCS) items were treated as even. Higher scores on this index indicate greater response inconsistency, suggesting a higher tendency toward careless responding.

#### Mahalanobis Distance

Mahalanobis Distance ($D^2$) is a multivariate measure used to detect outliers, including patterns that may indicate careless responding. It evaluates the distance of an individual’s response set from the overall distribution of responses in the dataset. Higher $D^2$ values suggest that a participant’s responses deviate markedly from the typical response pattern, potentially reflecting careless responding. Lower $D^2$ values indicate responses closer to the average, consistent with careful engagement.

#### Threshold

As a threshold, we used the 95th percentile of the mean distribution for each index. Participants whose scores exceeded this threshold in more than two indices were identified as careless responders. A total of 11 participants met this criterion and were excluded from subsequent Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data collection.

### Phase 2

For the EMA data, we conducted additional checks on the repeated administrations of the 8-item State Self-Compassion Scale to ensure response quality at the individual level. For each administration occasion, we computed the same four indices (Longstring Index, IRV, Even-Odd Inconsistency Index, and Mahalanobis Distance) and calculated their average for each participant. Using the same threshold (95th percentile of the mean distribution for each index), we identified participants exceeding this threshold in more than two indices. However, no participants met this criterion during the EMA phase. As a result, all participants who complied with the study’s response frequency requirements were included in the final statistical analyses.

### Integrating Metrics to Determine Careless Responding

```r
vectors <- list(mahad_bad, longstring_bad, irv_bad, even_odd_bad)

# Function to find shared elements across combinations
shared_counts <- map(2:4, ~ {
  combos <- combn(vectors, .x, simplify = FALSE)
  shared <- map(combos, ~ Reduce(intersect, .x)) %>% unlist() %>% unique()
  length(shared)
}) %>% set_names(paste0("shared_by_", 2:4))

# Output the results
shared_counts
# $shared_by_2
# [1] 3
# 
# $shared_by_3
# [1] 0
# 
# $shared_by_4
# [1] 0
