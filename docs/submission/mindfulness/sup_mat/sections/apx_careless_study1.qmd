To ensure data quality, we implemented a procedure for identifying and excluding participants exhibiting patterns of inattentive or careless responding.

### Compliance Rate

Missing data due to non-compliance can influence the validity of conclusions drawn from statistical inference, particularly when data are systematically missing (i.e., not missing at random), as this introduces bias. To address this issue, participants with a compliance rate below 50% were excluded from the study. This criterion resulted in the exclusion of 7 participants.

### Time to Complete (TTC)

The **Time to Complete (TTC)** was defined as the difference between the timestamp when a participant submitted the EMA survey and the timestamp when they began the survey. For each participant, we calculated the median TTC across all their submissions. 

To identify participants with unusually short TTCs, we applied the lower fence of the interquartile range (IQR) rule. None of the participants had TTC values below this threshold, indicating no evidence of careless responding in terms of the average response times.

### Assessing Careless Responding on the State Self-Compassion Scale

Responses on the State Self-Compassion Scale were evaluated for potential careless responding using the **careless** R package, which provides multiple indices to assess response quality. Four metrics were computed to identify aberrant response patterns: the Longstring Index, Intra-Individual Response Variability (IRV), the Even-Odd Inconsistency Index, and Mahalanobis Distance. Together, these indices offer a comprehensive framework for evaluating the reliability of self-reported data.

#### Careless Responding Metrics

**Longstring Index**  
The Longstring Index identifies the longest sequence of identical responses within a measurement occasion. Higher values may indicate "straightlining," a common marker of inattentive behavior.

**Intra-Individual Response Variability (IRV)**  
IRV, calculated as the standard deviation of responses across consecutive items, reflects engagement. Lower IRV values suggest less variability, potentially indicating reduced attentiveness.

**Even-Odd Inconsistency Index**  
This index assesses response inconsistency by correlating mean scores from even- and odd-numbered items. Greater inconsistency between these subsets indicates a higher likelihood of careless responding.

**Mahalanobis Distance**  
Mahalanobis Distance ($D^2$) detects multivariate outliers by measuring deviations from typical response patterns. Elevated $D^2$ values suggest responses that differ significantly from the dataset norm.

#### Threshold for Careless Responding

Participants were flagged as potential careless responders if their scores exceeded the 95th percentile on any index. Those flagged on more than two indices were classified as careless responders.  

#### Integration of Metrics to Determine Careless Responding

The following R script calculates the number of participants exceeding thresholds across various combinations of indices:  

```r
vectors <- list(mahad_bad, longstring_bad, irv_bad, even_odd_bad)

# Count shared elements across index combinations
shared_counts <- map(2:4, ~ {
  combos <- combn(vectors, .x, simplify = FALSE)
  shared <- map(combos, ~ Reduce(intersect, .x)) %>% unlist() %>% unique()
  length(shared)
}) %>% set_names(paste0("shared_by_", 2:4))

# Results
shared_counts
# $shared_by_2
# [1] 3
# 
# $shared_by_3
# [1] 0
# 
# $shared_by_4
# [1] 0
```

#### Final Assessment

This analysis identified no participants exceeding thresholds on more than two indices during the EMA phase. 

Studi precedenti che, in generale, confrontando campioni di studenti volontari e campioni di Mechanicak Turk workers, emerge che  MTurk respondents were more careless than respondents from student groups [@aruguete2019serious]. 

A recent study examined specifically the problm of careless responding in EMA studies. In a sample of volunteer students, comparable to the present one, @hasselhorn2023modeling used latent profiles of momentary careless responding on the occasion level and latent classes of individuals (who differ in the distribution of careless responding profiles across occasions) on the person level to identify care less responding using multilevel latent class analysis (ML-LCA). At the person level, they identified four latent classes (“careful,” “frequently careless,” and two types of “infrequently careless” respondents). Importantly, the Frequently Careless Class comprised only the 2% of participants. 

This result aligns with findings from similar studies, which suggest that careless responding is rare in EMA contexts. Factors such as shorter questionnaires, voluntary participation, and the option to discontinue participation likely reduce inattentiveness compared to traditional cross-sectional surveys [@welling2021possible]. Consequently, all participants who met response frequency requirements were included in the final analyses.
