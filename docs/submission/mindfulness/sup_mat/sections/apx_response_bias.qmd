In a final analysis, we explored the potential impact of response bias. Our focus was on the subset of participants who exhibited a positive association between the CS and UCS components of the state self-compassion Scale. This positive relationship—where higher levels of CS coincide with higher levels of UCS—directly contradicts the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis, which posits an inverse relationship between these components. A Reviewer suggested that this unexpected pattern could stem from response biases, such as "careless responding" or "insufficient effort," where participants may repeatedly select the same response option for both components, irrespective of their actual subjective state.

To assess this possibility, we analyzed four established indices of careless responding: the Longstring Index, Intra-Individual Response Variability (IRV), Even-Odd Inconsistency Index, and Mahalanobis Distance. These indices were compared between two groups: participants with a positive UCS-CS association and all other participants. To ensure sufficient statistical power, this analysis utilized the combined dataset from both studies ($N = 495$).

### Analysis Steps

**Step 1: Identifying Positive UCS-CS Associations.** A hierarchical Bayesian model was fitted individually for each participant to estimate the slope between UCS and CS. This model accounted for the hierarchical structure of the data by incorporating random intercepts for participants, days, and measurements within days, as well as random slopes for CS and negative affect (NA) at the participant level. Interaction terms between CS and NA, as well as contextual factors (momentary, daily, and person-level evaluations), were included to account for potential modulation of UCS. A t-distribution was employed for the error term to address potential non-normality in the UCS data. Weakly informative priors ensured plausible parameter estimation, and posterior predictive checks confirmed that the model provided a good fit to the observed data.

Participants were classified as exhibiting a positive UCS-CS association if the lower bound of the 89% credible interval for the slope coefficient was positive. Based on this criterion, 52 participants (10.5% of the sample) were identified as belonging to the positive-slope group.

**Step 2: Comparing Careless Responding Indices.** To assess whether the positive UCS-CS associations were driven by response biases, a Bayesian multilevel analysis was conducted to compare the four indices of careless responding between the positive-slope group and the remaining participants. Separate regression models were fitted for each index, accounting for the nested structure of the data with random effects specified for participants, days, and time windows within days. These models allowed us to robustly estimate differences in systematic response behavior between the two groups.

**Results and Interpretation.** The Bayesian analyses provided posterior estimates of differences in careless responding indices between participants with positive UCS-CS associations and those without. These estimates allowed us to evaluate whether the observed positive associations reflected genuine deviations from the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis or were artifacts of systematic response biases. By incorporating hierarchical modeling and Bayesian estimation, this analysis offered a nuanced approach to understanding the potential role of response behavior in shaping the observed patterns, contributing to the reliability and interpretability of the study’s findings.


### Longstring Index

The Longstring Index measures the longest sequence of consecutive identical responses provided by a participant during a single measurement occasion. Elevated values on this index may indicate "straightlining," a response pattern commonly linked to inattentive or careless behavior. If participants with a positive UCS-CS association show a higher average Longstring Index, it could suggest a greater tendency toward careless responding within this group.

To assess the relationship between group membership and the Longstring Index, we employed a hierarchical Bayesian cumulative ordinal regression model using the `brm` function from the `brms` R package. The model was specified as follows:

```r
mod_longstring <- brm(
  formula = longstring_val ~ is_pos_slope_group +
    (1 | user_id / day / time_window),
  family = cumulative(link = "logit"),  
  data = df_result,                     
  backend = "cmdstanr"                 
)
```

This model accounts for the nested structure of the data (measurements within time windows, nested within days and participants) while estimating the effect of group membership on the Longstring Index.

**Interpretation.** The posterior estimate for the effect of group membership (`is_pos_slope_group1`) suggests no credible difference in the Longstring Index between participants with positive UCS-CS associations and those without. The small effect size and wide credible interval indicate substantial uncertainty about the group effect, suggesting that both groups exhibit similar response patterns in terms of the Longstring Index.


### Intra-Individual Response Variability

Intra-Individual Response Variability (IRV) refers to the standard deviation of responses across a set of consecutive items for a given individual (Dunn et al., 2018). Lower IRV values are commonly associated with a greater propensity for careless responding, as they indicate reduced variability in response patterns.

To investigate the relationship between group membership and IRV, we employed a hierarchical Bayesian regression model with a skew-normal likelihood using the `brm` function from the `brms` R package. The model is specified as follows:

```r
mod_irv <- brm(
  formula = irv_val ~ is_pos_slope_group +
    (1 | user_id / day / time_window),
  family = skew_normal(),              # Skew-normal likelihood
  data = df_irv,                       # Input data
  backend = "cmdstanr"                 # Computational backend
)
```

This model accounts for the nested structure of the data, incorporating random effects for participants (`user_id`), days, and time windows to appropriately capture within-person variability.

**Interpretation.** The posterior estimate for the effect of group membership (`is_pos_slope_group1`) indicates no credible difference in IRV between participants with positive UCS-CS associations and those without. The narrow credible interval and small effect size suggest that both groups exhibit similar levels of intra-individual response variability. This finding implies that group membership does not meaningfully impact variability in response patterns. 


### Even-Odd Inconsistency Index

The Even-Odd Inconsistency Index assesses response inconsistency by dividing a unidimensional scale into two subsets—one composed of even-numbered items and the other of odd-numbered items—and analyzing their relationship. Higher scores on this index suggest a greater likelihood of careless responding. The calculation procedure involves the following steps:

1. **Split the scale**: Divide the items into two subsets: even-numbered items form one subset, and odd-numbered items form the other.
2. **Compute subscale scores**: Calculate the average response for each subset, producing two scores—one for the even subscale and one for the odd subscale.
3. **Calculate within-person correlation**: Compute the correlation between the two subscale scores for each participant, treating even scores as variable $x$ and odd scores as variable $y$.
4. **Adjust for scale length**: Use the Spearman–Brown prophecy formula to adjust the correlation for the reduced scale length.
5. **Determine the inconsistency score**: Compute the final score as $0 - r(x, y)$, where higher values indicate greater response inconsistency.

In the present analysis, the Compassionate Self (CS) items were assigned to the odd subset, and the Uncompassionate Self (UCS) items to the even subset. This approach ensures alignment with the bipolar nature of the CS-UCS construct.

To analyze the relationship between group membership and the Even-Odd Inconsistency Index, we used a hierarchical Bayesian regression model with an asymmetric Laplace likelihood, specified as follows:

```r
mod_evenodd <- brm(
  formula = evenodd_val ~ is_pos_slope_group +
    (1 | user_id / day / time_window),
  family = asym_laplace(),             # Asymmetric Laplace likelihood
  data = df_evenodd_clean,             # Cleaned input data
  backend = "cmdstanr"                 # Computational backend
)
```

This model accounts for the nested structure of the data, incorporating random effects for participants (`user_id`), days, and time windows to properly model within-person variability.

| Intercept              | 0.05     | 0.02       | 0.01         | 0.09         | 1.00 | 988      | 845      |
| pos_slope_group    | 0.11     | 0.05       | 0.01         | 0.22         | 1.00 | 850      | 897      |

**Interpretation.** The posterior estimate for the effect of group membership (`is_pos_slope_group1`) suggests no credible difference in the Even-Odd Inconsistency Index between participants with positive UCS-CS associations and those without. The slight effect size and overlapping credible intervals indicate that response inconsistency does not vary meaningfully by group.


### Mahalanobis Distance

Mahalanobis Distance ($D^2$) is a multivariate measure that detects outliers by quantifying how far an individual’s response set deviates from the overall distribution of responses in the dataset. Higher $D^2$ values indicate responses that differ significantly from typical patterns, potentially signaling careless responding. Conversely, lower $D^2$ values suggest responses closer to the average, reflecting greater engagement and consistency.

To examine the relationship between group membership and Mahalanobis Distance, we employed a hierarchical Bayesian regression model with an asymmetric Laplace likelihood, specified as follows:

```r
mod_mahad <- brm(
  formula = mahad_val ~ is_pos_slope_group +
    (1 | user_id / day / time_window),
  family = asym_laplace(),             # Asymmetric Laplace likelihood
  data = df,                           # Input data
  backend = "cmdstanr"                 # Computational backend
)
```

This model incorporates random effects for participants (`user_id`), days, and time windows to account for the nested structure of the data and to appropriately model within-person variability.

**Interpretation.** The posterior estimate for the effect of group membership (`is_pos_slope_group1`) indicates no credible difference in Mahalanobis Distance between participants with positive UCS-CS associations and those without. The small effect size and overlapping credible intervals suggest that response patterns do not vary meaningfully by group. This implies that both groups exhibit similar levels of response consistency.


### Time to Completion

Time to Completion measures the time participants take to complete all items in a single notification. It serves as a potential indicator of response quality, with unusually fast or slow times suggesting inattentive or disengaged behavior. Extremely short completion times might indicate careless responding or "speeding," while excessively long times could reflect distractions or difficulty with the task.

To examine whether group membership influences Time to Completion, we fit a hierarchical Bayesian regression model with a shifted log-normal likelihood, specified as follows:

```r
mod_rt <- brm(
  formula = rt ~ is_positive_slope_group +
    (1 | user_id / day / time_window),
  family = shifted_lognormal(),       # Shifted log-normal likelihood for response times
  data = rt_df,                       # Input data
  backend = "cmdstanr"                # Computational backend
)
```

This model accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data by including random effects for participants (`user_id`), days, and time windows, enabling appropriate modeling of within-person variability in response times.

**Interpretation.** The posterior estimate for the effect of group membership (`is_positive_slope_group1`) suggests no credible difference in Time to Completion between participants with positive UCS-CS associations and those without. The small effect size and overlapping credible intervals indicate that both groups exhibit similar patterns in the time required to complete items, implying no substantial differences in response behavior related to engagement or attentiveness.
