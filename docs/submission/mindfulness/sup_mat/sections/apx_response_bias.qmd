In this study, we identified a subset of participants who demonstrated a positive association between the Compassionate Self (CS) and Uncompassionate Self (UCS) components of the State Self-Compassion Scale. This positive association, characterized by higher levels of CS coinciding with higher levels of UCS, stands in direct opposition to the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis, which posits an inverse relationship between these components. A Reviewer suggested that this finding might be attributed to response biases, such as "careless responding" or "insufficient effort." These biases could manifest as participants consistently selecting the same response option, irrespective of their actual subjective state.

To evaluate this alternative explanation, we analyzed four indices of careless responding—Longstring Index, Intra-Individual Response Variability (IRV), Even-Odd Inconsistency Index, and Mahalanobis Distance. We compared these indices between two groups: participants exhibiting a positive UCS-CS association and all other participants. To maximize statistical power, this analysis was conducted using the combined dataset from both studies ($N = 495$).

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Identifying Positive UCS-CS Associations
A hierarchical Bayesian model was fitted individually for each participant to estimate the slope between UCS and CS. This model accounted for the hierarchical structure of the data by incorporating random intercepts for participants, days, and measurements within days, as well as random slopes for CS and negative affect (NA) at the participant level. Interaction terms between CS and NA, as well as contextual factors (momentary, daily, and person-level evaluations), were included to account for potential modulation of UCS. A t-distribution was employed for the error term to address potential non-normality in the UCS data. Weakly informative priors ensured plausible parameter estimation, and posterior predictive checks confirmed that the model provided a good fit to the observed data.

Participants were classified as exhibiting a positive UCS-CS association if the lower bound of the 89% credible interval for the slope coefficient was positive. Based on this criterion, 52 participants (10.5% of the sample) were identified as belonging to the positive-slope group.

### Step 2: Comparing Careless Responding Indices
To assess whether the positive UCS-CS associations were driven by response biases, a Bayesian multilevel analysis was conducted to compare the four indices of careless responding between the positive-slope group and the remaining participants. Separate regression models were fitted for each index, accounting for the nested structure of the data with random effects specified for participants, days, and time windows within days. These models allowed us to robustly estimate differences in systematic response behavior between the two groups.

## Results and Interpretation
The Bayesian analyses provided posterior estimates of differences in careless responding indices between participants with positive UCS-CS associations and those without. These estimates allowed us to evaluate whether the observed positive associations reflected genuine deviations from the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis or were artifacts of systematic response biases. By incorporating hierarchical modeling and Bayesian estimation, this analysis offered a nuanced approach to understanding the potential role of response behavior in shaping the observed patterns, contributing to the reliability and interpretability of the study’s findings.

### Longstring Index

The Longstring index measures the longest sequence of consecutive identical responses provided by a participant during a single measurement occasion. A high Longstring index may indicate "straightlining," a response pattern often associated with careless or inattentive behavior. If the posterior estimate of the average Longstring index is credibly higher for participants with a positive UCS-CS association, it would suggest that this group exhibits a greater tendency toward careless responding.

To investigate the relationship between group membership and the Longstring index, we employed a hierarchical Bayesian cumulative ordinal regression model using the `brm` function from the `brms` R package. The model specification is as follows:

```r
mod_longstring <- brm(
  formula = longstring_val ~ is_pos_slope_group +
    (1 | user_id / day / time_window),
  family = cumulative(link = "logit"),  # Cumulative ordinal regression
  data = df_result,                     # Input data
  backend = "cmdstanr"                  # Backend for computation
)
```

**Model Details:**

- **Outcome Variable**: `longstring_val`, representing the Longstring index, is treated as an ordinal variable.
- **Predictor**: `is_pos_slope_group`, a binary variable indicating group membership:
  - `1`: Participants with a positive UCS-CS slope, where the 89% credible interval does not include zero.
  - `0`: All other participants.
- **Random Effects**: The model accounts for hierarchical clustering at three levels:
  - **User ID** (`user_id`): Captures between-subject variability.
  - **Day** (`day`): Accounts for within-subject, day-to-day variability.
  - **Time Window** (`time_window`): Addresses measurement occasion-specific variability within each day.
- **Link Function**: A cumulative logit link is used, appropriate for ordinal outcomes.

This model structure allows us to estimate the impact of group membership on the Longstring index while appropriately accounting for the nested structure of the data.

### Intra-Individual Response Variability

Intra-Individual Response Variability (IRV) is defined as the standard deviation of responses across a set of consecutive items for a given individual (Dunn et al., 2018). A lower IRV is often interpreted as an indicator of a greater tendency toward careless responding.


### Even-Odd Inconsistency Index

The Even-Odd Inconsistency Index measures response inconsistency by dividing a unidimensional scale into two halves—an even-odd split—and analyzing the relationship between the two subsets of items. The procedure is as follows: 

1. **Split the scale**: Items are divided into two subsets, with even-numbered items forming one subset and odd-numbered items forming the other.  
2. **Compute subscale scores**: The average response for each subset is calculated, resulting in two scores—one for the even subscale and one for the odd subscale.  
3. **Calculate within-person correlation**: A correlation is computed between the two subscale scores for each participant, treating the even scores as variable $x$ and the odd scores as variable $y$, resulting in a correlation coefficient $r(x, y)$.  
4. **Correct for scale length**: The correlation is adjusted for the reduced length of the scale using the Spearman–Brown prophecy formula.  
5. **Compute the inconsistency score**: The final score is calculated as $0 - r(x, y)$, where higher values indicate a greater likelihood of careless responding.

For the present analysis, the Compassionate Self (CS) items were treated as odd, and the Uncompassionate Self (UCS) items were treated as even. Higher scores on this index indicate greater response inconsistency, suggesting a higher tendency toward careless responding.


### Mahalanobis Distance

Mahalanobis Distance ($D^2$) is a multivariate measure used to detect outliers, including patterns that may indicate careless responding. It evaluates the distance of an individual’s response set from the overall distribution of responses in the dataset. Higher $D^2$ values suggest that a participant’s responses deviate markedly from the typical response pattern, potentially reflecting careless responding. Lower $D^2$ values indicate responses closer to the average, consistent with careful engagement.
