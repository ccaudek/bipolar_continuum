The analyses presented in the previous section support the "essential unidimensionality" of state self-compassion [@reise2013scoring]. Using a multilevel framework that accounted for repeated measurements over a three-month period, we showed that compassionate and uncompassionate self-responding (CS and UCS) are inversely related at the *nomothetic level*—when examined across the entire sample. These findings align with Neff's hypothesis of a bipolar continuum, suggesting that CS and UCS function as opposing dimensions.

Our psychometric evaluations, relying on *internal criteria* such as fit indices for item scores, showed that more complex models improved statistical fit. However, these improvements did not substantially alter the overarching conclusion. While such models revealed minor deviations, their practical importance was limited, and the core pattern remained consistent with the bipolar continuum hypothesis. 

Further validation using *external criteria*—specifically, the effects of covariates such as momentary negative affect and context evaluation, as analyzed in the two studies presented in this manuscript—confirmed that these situational factors did not alter the core inverse relationship between CS and UCS. These results collectively strengthen the evidence for the robustness of the proposed bipolar continuum.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that all these prior analyses were conducted at a *nomothetic level*, focusing on group-level patterns. This aggregated perspective, while informative, risks obscuring the ways self-compassion may vary across individuals and contexts. In fact, the dynamics of self-compassion in everyday life—how CS and UCS interact within the unique contexts of individual experiences—may not be fully captured when averaged across the sample. Understanding this variability is crucial for a more complete picture of how self-compassion operates.

To address this limitation, we conducted an *idionomic analysis* to investigate the relationship between CS and UCS at the individual level [@ciarrochi2024compassion; @ferrari2022embracing; @sahdra2024testing]. This approach shifts the focus from group-level averages to person-specific dynamics, enabling the exploration of heterogeneity in self-compassion processes. By examining the interaction of CS and UCS within individuals over time, the idionomic analysis provides a more nuanced understanding of how these constructs function in daily life and reveals patterns that may be masked in nomothetic analyses.



### Idionomic Analysis of the Relationship Between UCS and CS

For the present purposes, an idionomic analysis was conducted in two stages. The first stage involved a strictly idiographic approach, focusing on the individual-level patterns. In the second stage, we applied a nomothetic approach to examine and describe group-level regularities as well as the variability in these effects across individuals  [e.g., @ciarrochi2024compassion; @sahdra2024testing].

**Step 1: Fitting Individual-Level Hierarchical Bayesian Models.** For each participant separatedly, we implemented a hierarchical Bayesian model using Stan to estimate the relationship between UCS and CS. The model incorporated additional covariates, including negative affect and context evaluation, as well as lagged effects of CS from the previous measurement within the same day. The model for each participant was specified as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{UCS}_n \sim t_{\nu}\Big( & \alpha + \gamma_{\text{CS}} \cdot \text{CS}_n + \gamma_{\text{neg\_aff}} \cdot \text{neg\_aff}_n \\
& + \gamma_{\text{context}} \cdot \text{context}_n + \phi \cdot \text{lag\_CS}_n \\
& + \gamma_{\text{interaction}} \cdot \text{CS}_n \cdot \text{neg\_aff}_n, \sigma \Big),
\end{aligned}
$$

where:

- $\text{UCS}_n$ represents the CS score for observation $n$,
- $\alpha$ denotes the intercept,
- $\gamma_{\text{CS}}$ is the coefficient for the primary predictor, CS ($\text{CS}_n$),
- $\gamma_{\text{neg\_aff}}$ and $\gamma_{\text{context}}$ are coefficients for negative affect ($\text{neg\_aff}_n$) and context evaluation ($\text{context}_n$), respectively,
- $\phi$ represents the autoregressive coefficient for the lagged CS within the same day ($\text{lag\_CS}_n$),
- $\sigma$ is the scale parameter (standard deviation) of the distribution,
- $\nu$ denotes the degrees of freedom of the Student's $t$-distribution,
- $\gamma_{\text{interaction}}$ is the coefficient for the interaction term between CS and negative affect. 

This model allows for the examination of the association between UCS and CS while controlling for the effects of negative affect, context evaluation, lagged CS effects within the same day, and the CS $\times$ negative-affect interaction. We employed a Student's $t$-distribution ($t_{\nu}$) to account for potential outliers or heavy-tailed distributions in the data.

For each participant, we examined the posterior distribution of the `gamma_CS` coefficient to estimate the proportion of posterior draws that were negative. This enabled us to evaluate whether there was evidence of a negative association between UCS and CS at the individual level, in line with Neff's bipolar continuum hypothesis. Additionally, we computed the mean posterior estimates for the `gamma_neg_aff`, `gamma_context`, and `gamma_interaction` parameters, which represent the effects of negative affect, context evaluation, and the interaction between CS and negative affect, respectively, on UCS for each participant.

**Step 2: Aggregate Analysis Using a Hierarchical Model.** After the idiographic analysis, we used a hierarchical model [e.g., @ciarrochi2024compassion] in the `brms` package (`R`) to summarize the proportion of negative estimates for the `gamma_CS` parameter across participants. This model employed a binomial distribution, with the total number of posterior samples as the denominator and the proportion of negative estimates as the response. A random intercept for participants was included to account for individual variability.

Hierarchical models were also applied to the mean posterior estimates of the `gamma_neg_aff`, `gamma_context`, and `gamma_interaction` parameters, representing the influences of negative affect, context evaluation, and the interaction between CS and negative affect on UCS. Each model included a fixed effect (intercept) and random intercepts for participants, capturing individual differences. A Student-$t$ likelihood was used to account for potential outliers and accommodate the heavy-tailed nature of the effect distributions, providing robust aggregate estimates of each parameter and the heterogeneity of their relationships with UCS.

#### Results

The analysis of the `gamma_CS` parameter across participants indicated that 81.0% (89% CI [0.796, 0.823]) of the posterior estimates for the association between uncompassionate self-responding (UCS) and compassionate self-responding (CS) were negative. This supports Neff's bipolar continuum hypothesis, which posits an inverse relationship between UCS and CS. However, the variability in individual effects (`sd(Intercept)` = 1.25, corresponding to 0.196 on the probability scale) suggests moderate heterogeneity in the strength of this relationship across participants.

For the influence of negative affect on UCS, represented by the `gamma_neg_aff` parameter, the analysis revealed a positive overall effect (intercept = 0.38, 89% CI [0.34, 0.42]), indicating that higher levels of negative affect are generally associated with increased UCS. The variability between individuals (`sd(Intercept)` = 0.19, corresponding to 0.547 on the probability scale) suggests substantial heterogeneity in how strongly negative affect influences UCS.

The analysis of context evaluation showed a small but credible negative effect on UCS (mean = -0.04, 95% CI [-0.07, -0.01]), suggesting that higher context evaluation scores are associated with a slight reduction in UCS. The variability in individual responses (`sd(Intercept)` = 0.17, corresponding to 0.543 on the probability scale) also indicates substantial heterogeneity in the relationship between context evaluation and UCS across participants.

Finally, the interaction between CS and negative affect was negligible, with the 89% credible interval spanning zero (-0.03, 0.00), suggesting no meaningful interaction effect between these variables on UCS.

### Discussion

Our idionomic analysis offers critical insights into the momentary relationship between CS and UCS, providing an individual-level test of Neff's Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis. The group-level findings largely supported the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis, indicating that CS and UCS function as inversely related dimensions for most participants. However, the model also revealed substantial variability in this relationship across individuals, suggesting that the Bipolar Continuum may not universally apply.

The majority of participants demonstrated a negative association between CS and UCS, consistent with the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis. However, a notable subset exhibited either no clear association or even positive correlations, where CS and UCS varied together. These findings challenge the universality of the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis, suggesting that self-compassion does not always function as two strictly opposing dimensions. Such variability underscores the importance of idiographic analyses, which can reveal nuanced patterns obscured by aggregate, group-level approaches (Ferrari et al., 2023; Ullrich et al., 2020).

The model described below provided a test of contextual and temporal influences on the CS-UCS relationship. Negative affect was associated with higher UCS levels, indicating that heightened negative emotional states amplify uncompassionate self-responding. However, there was no credible evidence that negative affect moderated the inverse relationship between CS and UCS, suggesting that momentary emotional states do not alter how CS influences UCS. Similarly, while context evaluations were linked to UCS levels, they did not meaningfully disrupt the CS-UCS dynamic, supporting the stability of the bipolar structure.

The inclusion of lagged CS as a predictor allowed for the examination of temporal dependencies within the same day. The findings suggest that prior CS levels had a modest influence on UCS, indicating some degree of temporal continuity in self-compassion processes. However, the constrained effect of lagged CS also highlights the stability of the core relationship between CS and UCS, which remains largely unaffected by immediate past states.

Overall, these results strengthen the evidence for the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis while acknowledging its limitations. The variability observed across individuals suggests that the continuum may be a stable structure for some but more flexible or context-dependent for others. By incorporating idiographic methods, this study demonstrates that the relationship between CS and UCS is both robust and context-sensitive, highlighting the value of moving beyond group-level analyses to explore the diverse ways self-compassion operates in daily life. 

This analysis ultimately reaffirms the utility of the Bipolar Continuum framework while advocating for a more nuanced understanding of its applicability across individuals and contexts.

#### Step 1

This section details the specification of the model fitted separately to individual data from both experiments, constituting the first step of our idiographic analysis.

We employed a hierarchical Bayesian model with the following characteristics:

1. **Response Variable**: Uncompassionate Self-Responding (UCS).
2. **Primary Predictor**: Compassionate Self-Responding (CS).
3. **Covariates**:
   - `neg_aff_Moment`: Momentary negative affect.
   - `context_Moment`: Context evaluation.
   - `lag_CS_same_day`: Lagged CS from the same day.
4. **Distribution**: Student's t-distribution to account for potential outliers or heavy-tailed response distributions
5. **Temporal Dependency**: Incorporated an AR(1) component to account for autoregressive effects of UCS.

#### Model Parameters

- `gamma_CS`: Coefficient representing the association between CS and UCS.
- `gamma_neg_aff`: Slope for negative affect (`neg_aff_Moment`).
- `gamma_context`: Slope for context evaluation (`context_Moment`).
- `phi`: Autoregressive coefficient for the lagged CS effect.
- `nu`: Degrees of freedom for the Student's $t$-distribution (estimated by the model).
- `alpha`: Intercept term.
- `sigma`: Scale parameter of the Student's $t$-distribution.

#### Stan Model Specification

```stan
data {
  int<lower=1> N;
  vector[N] CS;
  vector[N] UCS;
  vector[N] neg_aff_Moment;
  vector[N] context_Moment;
  vector[N] lag_CS_same_day;
}

parameters {
  real alpha_raw;
  real gamma_CS_raw;
  real gamma_neg_aff_raw;
  real gamma_context_raw;
  real phi_raw;
  real<lower=0> sigma;
  real<lower=2> nu;
}

transformed parameters {
  real alpha = alpha_raw;
  real gamma_CS = gamma_CS_raw;
  real gamma_neg_aff = gamma_neg_aff_raw;
  real gamma_context = gamma_context_raw;
  real phi = phi_raw * 0.5;  // Constraining phi to [-0.5, 0.5] for stability
}

model {
  // Priors
  alpha_raw ~ normal(0, 1);
  gamma_CS_raw ~ normal(0, 1);
  gamma_neg_aff_raw ~ normal(0, 1);
  gamma_context_raw ~ normal(0, 1);
  phi_raw ~ normal(0, 1);
  sigma ~ cauchy(0, 2.5);
  nu ~ gamma(2, 0.1);
  
  // Likelihood
  UCS ~ student_t(nu, alpha + gamma_CS * CS + gamma_neg_aff * neg_aff_Moment + 
                  gamma_context * context_Moment + phi * lag_CS_same_day, sigma);
}
```

This Stan code implements the hierarchical Bayesian model described above. The model uses weakly informative priors for all parameters and constrains the autoregressive coefficient `phi` to the interval [-0.5, 0.5] to ensure model stability. The degrees of freedom parameter `nu` is constrained to be greater than 2 to ensure finite variance of the Student's $t$-distribution.


### Step 2

In the second step of our idionomic analysis, we employed a hierarchical model approach, analogous to a meta-analysis [@ciarrochi2024compassion]. This method allowed us to synthesize the individual-level results across all participants, providing both an aggregate estimate of the effects and a measure of heterogeneity among participants.

#### Model Specification

We fitted a hierarchical binomial model to the proportion of negative posterior draws for the `gamma_CS` parameter. In this framework, each participant was treated as a unique "study," enabling us to estimate:

1. The aggregate proportion of negative effects across all participants.
2. The degree of heterogeneity in these effects among participants.

The model was implemented using the `brms` package in `R`.

```r
fit_gamma_cs_binom <- brm(
  bf(n_negative | trials(n_total) ~ 1 + (1 | id), family = "binomial"),
  data = beta_cs_df,
  prior = c(
    prior(normal(0, 1), class = "Intercept"),
    prior(normal(0, 1), class = "sd")  
  ),
  iter = 100000, warmup = 2000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
  backend = "cmdstanr",
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99, max_treedepth = 15)
)
```

**Model Components.**

- **Formula**: `n_negative | trials(n_total) ~ 1 + (1 | id)`
  - `n_negative`: Count of negative posterior draws.
  - `n_total`: Total number of posterior draws
  - `(1 | id)`: Random intercept for each participant.

- **Family**: Binomial, appropriate for modeling proportions.

- **Priors**: 
  - `normal(0, 1)` for the intercept and standard deviation of random effects.
  - These priors are weakly informative, allowing the data to drive the results while providing some regularization.

- **MCMC Settings**: 
  - 100,000 iterations with 2,000 warmup.
  - 4 chains run in parallel.
  - Increased `adapt_delta` and `max_treedepth` for improved MCMC convergence.

#### Extension to Other Parameters

We applied a similar hierarchical modeling approach to analyze the posterior distributions of other key parameters from the idiographic analyses:

- `gamma_neg_aff`: Coefficient for negative affect.
- `gamma_context`: Coefficient for context evaluation.
- `gamma_interaction`: Coefficient for potential interaction effects.


### Posterior Predictive Checks

In the following sections, we present the results of the Posterior Predictive Checks for the four models used to assess the aggregate effects and heterogeneity in our idiographic analysis. These models evaluate the linear association between UCS and CS, the effect of negative affect, the influence of contextual evaluation, and the interaction between CS and negative affect.
