Previous research has extensively explored the bipolar continuum hypothesis by investigating the dimensionality of *trait* self-compassion using various psychometric approaches [@brenner2017two; @cleare2018investigation; @neff2016self; @neff2017examining; @neff2019examining; @petrocchi2014dimensionality]. These studies consistently show that models including a general factor yield superior fit indices, offering strong empirical support for Neff’s hypothesis.

The current study seeks to build upon this foundation by conducting a novel psychometric evaluation of the dimensionality of *state* self-compassion. Our analysis is unique in that it examines repeated measurements of *state* self-compassion within the same participants. To address the multilevel nature of the data, we applied a series of multilevel Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) models to the combined datasets from both studies. This approach allows for a precise representation of the hierarchical structure, where repeated measurements are nested within days, which are further nested within individuals.

We specified and compared three distinct models to determine the underlying structure of state self-compassion:

- The **One-Factor Model** hypothesizes that state self-compassion can be represented by a single latent factor, capturing variance at both the within-person and between-person levels.

- The **Two-Factor Model** conceptualizes state self-compassion as comprising two correlated but distinct latent factors—CS (compassionate self-responding) and UCS (uncompassionate self-responding)—functioning at both the within-person and between-person levels.

- The **Bifactor Model** examines whether state self-compassion is best characterized by a general self-compassion factor along with orthogonal specific factors (CS and UCS), isolating the variance explained by the general factor from that explained by the specific factors.

The table presents standardized loadings for both the general factor and the specific positive and negative factors at the within and between levels. These loadings illustrate the bifactor structure and how each item loads onto the general and specific factors.

#### Interpretation 

**General Factor.** The **general factor** exhibited strong and consistent loadings across items, particularly at the between-subject level (ranging from 0.143 to 0.935), reflecting a robust overarching construct of self-compassion across individuals. The within-subject loadings were also notable, albeit slightly weaker (0.210 to 0.623). This suggests that the general factor captures substantial common variance among items both across and within individuals.

- Items SCP7 ("At this moment I am able to accept my flaws and weaknesses"; between-level loading: 0.935) and SCP1 ("I'm giving myself the caring and tenderness I need"; 0.860) demonstrated the strongest loadings at the between-subject level, indicating their critical role in representing the general self-compassion construct.
- SCN8 ("At this moment I let myself be carried away by my emotions") exhibited weak loadings on the general factor at both levels (within: 0.210; between: 0.143), implying limited shared variance with the general factor and potentially unique characteristics for this item.

**Specific Factors.** The **positive and negative factors** captured variance unique to the positive and negative components of self-compassion, beyond what is explained by the general factor.

1. **Positive Factor**:
   - Within-subject loadings for SCP1 and SCP7 were modest (0.219 and 0.246, respectively), while SCP3 ("I’m remembering that there are lots of others in the world feeling like I am") and SCP6 ("I'm keeping things in perspective") had negligible or negative loadings (-0.313 and -0.009, respectively). This suggests limited within-subject differentiation of the positive factor from the general factor.
   - Between-subject loadings were also modest but slightly stronger for SCP7 (0.322) and SCP1 (0.215), highlighting these items' modest roles in capturing positive-specific variance at the between-person level.

2. **Negative Factor**:
   - Negative items (e.g., SCN2 ("I'm obsessing and fixating on everything that’s wrong"), SCN4 ("I feel like I'm struggling more than others right now"), SCN5 ("I feel intolerant and impatient toward myself"), SCN8 ("At this moment I let myself be carried away by my emotions")) had moderate loadings on the negative factor at both levels, with slightly higher between-subject loadings (e.g., SCN2: 0.626, SCN4: 0.378). This indicates that the negative-specific factor captures meaningful unique variance, particularly across individuals.

**Implications.** 

- The strong loadings on the general factor, especially at the between-subject level, suggest that state self-compassion is predominantly a unidimensional construct at the higher level.
- The specific factors capture additional nuance, with the negative-specific factor demonstrating relatively more consistent loadings than the positive-specific factor. This may reflect a more distinct role for negative-specific items in characterizing individual differences in state self-compassion.
- Weak or negative loadings on specific factors (e.g., SCP3 on the positive factor) suggest that some items primarily contribute to the general factor, reinforcing the overarching nature of state self-compassion.

In summary, the bifactor model successfully captures both the shared variance across all state self-compassion items and the unique variance attributable to positive and negative components. The results emphasize the predominance of a general state self-compassion factor while acknowledging the contribution of specific dimensions, particularly for the negative-specific factor.

As shown in Table 1, the goodness-of-fit indices progressively improve from the One-Factor Model to the Two-Factor Model, with the Bifactor Model demonstrating the best overall fit. The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) both exceed the commonly accepted threshold of 0.95 for the Two-Factor and Bifactor Models, indicating strong model fit. Additionally, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) values decrease across models, further supporting improved fit with more complex structures.

We conducted a series of Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRTs) to formally assess improvements in model fit:

- Comparing the One-Factor Model with the Two-Factor Model yielded an LRT statistic of 1068.792 with 5 degrees of freedom ($p < 0.001$), indicating that the Two-Factor Model significantly improves fit. This suggests that conceptualizing state self-compassion as two distinct components (CS and UCS) better represents the data.
  
- The comparison between the Two-Factor Model and the Bifactor Model resulted in an LRT statistic of 506.656 with 17 degrees of freedom ($p < 0.001$), demonstrating that the Bifactor Model offers further improvement in fit. This suggests that, beyond distinct compassionate and uncompassionate components, a general self-compassion factor provides additional explanatory power.

In summary, from a psychometric standpoint, both the Two-Factor and Bifactor Models provide better fit than the One-Factor Model, with the Bifactor Model yielding the best statistical fit. These results suggest that self-compassion is best conceptualized as comprising both a general factor and specific components (CS and UCS). However, while the Bifactor Model offers superior statistical fit, its added complexity raises questions about the practical significance of modeling both general and specific factors.


### Practical Importance

While the previous section focused on the psychometric properties of the three multilevel CFA models under consideration, it is essential to emphasize that dimensionality assessments should not rely exclusively on statistical fit indices. Instead, they should also account for the substantive relevance and interpretability of each factor [@rodriguez2016evaluating; @ferrando2018assessing]. Although more complex models often achieve superior statistical fit, they risk overfitting the data, particularly when an excessive number of factors are included [@ferrando2019external]. Striking a balance between model complexity and interpretability is therefore critical to ensure that the conclusions drawn are both meaningful and practically applicable.

To determine whether the data support a unidimensional or multifactorial structure for *state* self-compassion, we applied several criteria:

1. **Factor Correlation**:  
   In the Two-Factor Model, the within-level correlation between the Compassionate Self (CS) and Uncompassionate Self (UCS) factors was 0.825, while the between-level correlation was 0.817. These high correlations suggest a strong overlap between the two factors, which might indicate a common underlying construct at both the within- and between-person levels. 

2. **Explained Common Variance (ECV)**:  
   ECV quantifies how much of the shared variance among items is explained by the general versus specific factors. In the Bifactor Model, the general factor ($\text{Gen}_w$) exhibited high standardized loadings on items (e.g., SCP1 = 0.614, SCN2 = 0.579 at the within-person level), indicating that it accounts for the majority of the common variance. By comparison, the loadings of the specific factors ($\text{POS}_w$ and $\text{NEG}_w$) were notably lower, suggesting that they explain less variance. This finding underscores the dominance of the general factor in accounting for self-compassion.

3. **Omega Hierarchical ($\omega_H$)**:  
   $\omega_H$ estimates how much of the variance in total scores is attributable to the general factor. In the Bifactor Model, the general factor explained a substantial proportion of the variance, while the specific factors contributed relatively little. This suggests that the general factor plays a predominant role in explaining individual differences in self-compassion, further supporting the interpretation of a primarily unidimensional construct.

4. **Bifactor Model Analysis**:  
   The Bifactor Model highlights the predominance of the general factor, as the loadings of the specific factors were consistently lower (e.g., $\text{POS}_w$ on SCP3 = -0.313, $\text{NEG}_b$ on SCN8 = 0.288). This indicates that the specific factors (CS and UCS) provide limited explanatory power beyond the general self-compassion factor. Consequently, the Bifactor Model supports a conceptualization where a single general factor underlies the variance in self-compassion, with the specific factors adding relatively small additional value.

5. **Change in R-squared**:  
   The Bifactor Model shows that the general factor accounts for a large proportion of the variance (e.g., R-squared for SCP1 = 0.425 at the within-person level, 0.786 at the between-person level). The specific factors contribute only marginally to the overall variance explained, suggesting that a unidimensional structure may be more parsimonious without significantly compromising the model’s explanatory power.

In summary, the results of the multilevel CFA analyses lend support to Neff’s hypothesis that, also for *state* self-compassion, CS and UCS are related at the global level. The strong correlations between CS and UCS at the latent level indicate that individuals who exhibit high levels of CS tend to have lower levels of UCS, and vice versa, reinforcing the notion that these two aspects are inversely related at a general level.

However, it is important to emphasize that multilevel CFA focuses on *latent, person-level relationships*, which capture broader, long-term patterns. The present findings show that, for *state* self-compassion, CS and UCS are correlated at a global, trait-like level across individuals. In contrast, analyses targeting *momentary dynamics* may reveal that, for *state* self-compassion, CS and UCS operate more independently within individuals during short-term, context-specific situations. This distinction highlights that while Neff’s hypothesis may hold at the global level, further investigation is necessary to explore the relationship between CS and UCS at the momentary, within-person level.
