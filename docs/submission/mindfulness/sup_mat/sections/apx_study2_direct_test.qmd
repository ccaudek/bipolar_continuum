We extended the main analyses by conducting a supplementary test of the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis using a nomothetic Bayesian hierarchical model. This approach replicated the framework described in @sec-nomothetic-an-study1, allowing direct comparisons across studies.

In Study 2, UCS was modeled as a linear function of CS, with momentary negative affect, decentering, and event unpleasantness included as covariates. Random effects at the participant, day, and measurement levels accounted for individual variability and temporal fluctuations. This hierarchical structure enabled the simultaneous examination of both inter-individual differences and intra-individual changes over time.

### Results

The findings supported the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis, mirroring those observed in Study 1 (see Figure 2). 

![The estimates reflect both inter-individual differences and intra-individual variations across days and moments. The bars represent 89% credibility intervals. $\beta_{CS}$ denotes the coefficient for CS; $\beta_\text{negative affect}$, $\beta_\text{context valence}$, and $\beta_\text{decentering}$ represent coefficients for negative affect, contextual valence, and decentering, respectively; $\sigma_\text{measurement}$, $\sigma_\text{day}$, and $\sigma_\text{participant}$ correspond to the standard deviations of random effects across measurements, days, and participants. $\sigma_\text{participant slope CS}$ captures the variability in CS slopes across participants; $\sigma_{UCS}$ reflects residual population-level variability.](sections/figures/plot_bch_mpath.pdf)

The analysis confirmed a strong negative association between CS and UCS ($\beta = -0.43$, 89% CI [-0.47, -0.39]), reinforcing the bipolar nature of the construct. Negative affect had a small positive effect on UCS ($\beta = 0.07$, 89% CI [0.06, 0.08]), while decentering showed an inverse relationship ($\beta = -0.08$, 89% CI [-0.09, -0.07]). Event unpleasantness had little impact on UCS, with its 89% credible interval including zero ($\beta = -0.005$, 89% CI [-0.016, 0.005]).

Random effects revealed substantial variability between participants ($\sigma_\text{participant} = 0.61$, 89% CI [0.56, 0.67]), reflecting meaningful individual differences in self-compassion responses. Day-to-day fluctuations in UCS were minimal ($\sigma_\text{day} = 0.04$, 89% CI [0.02, 0.06]), and measurement error was negligible ($\sigma_\text{measurement} = 0.01$, 89% CI [0.001, 0.039]). Participant-level variability in the effect of CS on UCS was moderate ($\sigma_\text{participant slope CS} = 0.29$, 89% CI [0.26, 0.32]). Residual variability in UCS ($\sigma_\text{UCS} = 0.39$, 89% CI [0.38, 0.41]) indicated that additional unmeasured factors may contribute to UCS.

In conclusion, the results from Study 2 provide further evidence for the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis. The negative association between CS and UCS underscores the conceptualization of state self-compassion as a bipolar construct. Contextual influences, such as negative affect and decentering, played a key role in shaping momentary positions along this continuum. While temporal fluctuations in UCS were small, substantial between-participant variability highlights the importance of individual differences in state self-compassion dynamics.
