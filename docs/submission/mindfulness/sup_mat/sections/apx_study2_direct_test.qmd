As observed in Study 1, both negative affect (NegAff) and contextual valence are key indicators of an individual's position on the bipolar continuum of state self-compassion, which ranges from Compassionate Self (CS) to Uncompassionate Self (UCS). High levels of NegAff were associated with proximity to the UCS pole, while low levels suggested alignment with the CS pole. Similarly, we expected that higher levels of contextual valence (i.e., more positive evaluations of context) would be associated with the CS pole. Additionally, decentering, an essential aspect of mindfulness, was anticipated to demonstrate an inverse relationship with UCS, with higher levels of decentering linked to the CS pole and lower levels indicating proximity to the UCS pole.

To replicate the analysis from Study 1, we tested the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis (BCH) with a nomothetic Bayesian hierarchical analysis. In this model, UCS was predicted linearly from CS, while also accounting for within-day centered NegAff, decentering, and the unpleasantness of the event as covariates. Random effects for participants, days, and the event unpleasantness were incorporated to address individual variability and measurement precision (see Figure 2).

The analysis revealed several significant fixed effects. A strong negative relationship between CS and UCS was observed (β = -0.43, 89% CI [-0.47, -0.39]), confirming that higher levels of CS correspond to lower levels of UCS and thus supporting the BCH. Higher levels of NegAff were associated with increased UCS (β = 0.07, 89% CI [0.06, 0.08]), indicating a modest positive influence. Decentering showed an inverse relationship with UCS (β = -0.08, 89% CI [-0.09, -0.07]), suggesting that higher mindfulness (decentering) is associated with lower levels of UCS. The impact of event unpleasantness was slight and marginally negative (β = -0.005, 89% CI [-0.016, 0.005]).

The random effects analysis revealed substantial variability in UCS levels among participants (β = 0.61, 89% CI [0.56, 0.67]), indicating individual differences in state self-compassion responses. Daily fluctuations were minor, with a median estimate of 0.04 (89% CI [0.02, 0.06]). The model also demonstrated high reliability, as indicated by minimal measurement error (median estimate: 0.01, 89% CI [0.001, 0.039]).

The analysis further highlighted individual differences in how CS influences UCS, with a random slope median estimate of 0.29 (89% CI [0.26, 0.32]). There was moderate unexplained variability in UCS (median estimate: 0.39, 89% CI [0.38, 0.41]), suggesting that additional factors beyond the scope of this model contribute to UCS levels.

In summary, the results from Study 2 echo those of Study 1, demonstrating a strong inverse relationship between CS and UCS, reinforcing the validity of the BCH. This robust negative correlation, observed even when accounting for momentary NegAff and other contextual factors, supports the hypothesis that self-compassion operates as a bipolar construct rather than as independent or synergistic elements. The influence of negative affect and decentering on UCS, coupled with the consistent individual differences, highlights the dynamic nature of state self-compassion and the nuanced roles of personal and contextual factors.

These findings underscore the applicability of the BCH across diverse contexts and individual differences. The minimal daily fluctuations and substantial between-person variability further emphasize the role of personal traits and situational factors in shaping state self-compassion responses.
