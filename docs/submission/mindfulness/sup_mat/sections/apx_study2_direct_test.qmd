As an extension of the main analyses, we conducted a supplementary test of the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis using a nomothetic Bayesian hierarchical model. This approach mirrors the analysis detailed in the Supplementary Material for Study 1, allowing for direct comparison across studies.  

Consistent with the findings of Study 1, negative affect and contextual factors were key indicators of an individual's position along the bipolar continuum of state self-compassion, ranging from CS to UCS. Higher levels of negative affect were associated with proximity to the UCS pole, while lower levels aligned with the CS pole. Similarly, more positive evaluations of context were expected to correspond to the CS pole. Decentering, a mindfulness-related process, was hypothesized to exhibit an inverse relationship with UCS, with higher levels of decentering linked to the CS pole and lower levels to the UCS pole.  

UCS was modeled as a linear function of CS while controlling for momentary negative affect, decentering, and event unpleasantness. Random effects at the participant, day, and measurement levels captured individual variability and temporal fluctuations (see Figure 2).

The bars represent 89% credibility intervals. $\beta_{CS}$ denotes the coefficient for CS; $\beta_\text{negative affect}$, $\beta_\text{context valence}$, and $\beta_\text{decentering}$ represent coefficients for negative affect, contextual valence, and decentering, respectively; $\sigma_\text{measurement}$, $\sigma_\text{day}$, and $\sigma_\text{participant}$ correspond to the standard deviations of random effects across measurements, days, and participants. $\sigma_\text{participant slope CS}$ captures the variability in CS slopes across participants; $\sigma_{UCS}$ reflects residual population-level variability.](sections/figures/plot_bch_mpath.pdf)  

### Key Findings  

**Fixed Effects:**  

  - CS was strongly negatively associated with UCS ($\beta = -0.43$, 89% CI [-0.47, -0.39]), confirming that higher CS levels correspond to lower UCS levels.  
  - Negative affect showed a modest positive effect on UCS ($\beta = 0.07$, 89% CI [0.06, 0.08]).  
  - Decentering had an inverse effect on UCS ($\beta = -0.08$, 89% CI [-0.09, -0.07]), indicating that greater mindfulness is associated with lower UCS levels.  
  - Event unpleasantness exhibited minimal and statistically inconclusive effects on UCS ($\beta = -0.005$, 89% CI [-0.016, 0.005]).  

**Random Effects:**  

  - Substantial between-participant variability was observed in UCS levels ($\sigma_\text{participant} = 0.61$, 89% CI [0.56, 0.67]).  
  - Day-to-day fluctuations in UCS were minor ($\sigma_\text{day} = 0.04$, 89% CI [0.02, 0.06]).  
  - Measurement error was negligible ($\sigma_\text{measurement} = 0.01$, 89% CI [0.001, 0.039]).  
  - Participant-level variability in the effect of CS on UCS was moderate ($\sigma_\text{participant slope CS} = 0.29$, 89% CI [0.26, 0.32]).  
  - Residual population variability in UCS was estimated at $\sigma_\text{UCS} = 0.39$, 89% CI [0.38, 0.41], suggesting that additional unmeasured factors influence UCS.  

### Conclusion  

The results from Study 2 align closely with those of Study 1, supporting the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis. The robust negative association between CS and UCS persisted after controlling for momentary negative affect and contextual factors, reinforcing the conceptualization of state self-compassion as a bipolar construct.  

These findings underscore the dynamic interplay of personal and contextual influences on state self-compassion. While day-to-day fluctuations were minimal, substantial between-person variability highlights the critical role of individual differences in shaping self-compassion responses. 

For this analysis, we employed the same Stan model utilized in Study 1.
