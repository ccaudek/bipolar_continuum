As observed in Study 1, both negative affect and contextual valence are key indicators of an individual's position on the bipolar continuum of state self-compassion, ranging from CS to UCS. Specifically, high levels of NegAff were associated with proximity to the UCS pole, while low levels of NegAff suggested alignment with the CS pole. A similar pattern can be expected with contextual valence. Decentering, a core aspect of mindfulness, is expected to show that higher degrees of decentering are linked to the CS pole, whereas lower degrees indicate proximity to the UCS pole. Thus, it is reasonable to expect also in Study 2 that NegAff and decentering would demonstrate inverse relationships with state self-compassion components. 
To replicate the analysis from Study 1 for testing the BCH, we conducted a Bayesian hierarchical analysis. In this model, the UCS component of state self-compassion was predicted linearly from the CS component. We included as covariates the within-day centered NegAff, decentering, and the level of unpleasantness of the event. Random effects were incorporated for participants, days, and the level of unpleasantness of the event to account for individual variability and measurement precision – see Figure 2.
The analysis revealed several key fixed effects. A strong negative relationship was observed (β = -0.43, 89% CI [-0.47, -0.39]), corroborating the hypothesis that higher levels of CS correspond to lower levels of UCS, thus supporting the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis (BCH). Higher levels of NegAff were associated with increased UCS (β = 0.07, 89% CI [0.06, 0.08]), indicating a modest positive influence. Higher levels of decentering were linked to reduced UCS (β = -0.08, 89% CI [-0.09, -0.07]), suggesting an inverse relationship. The impact of event unpleasantness was slight and marginally negative (β = -0.005, 89% CI [-0.016, 0.005]).
The random effects analysis provided additional insights. There was substantial variability in baseline UCS levels among participants, with a median estimate of 0.61 (89% CI [0.56, 0.67]). Daily fluctuations were negligible, with a median estimate of 0.04 (89% CI [0.02, 0.06]). The data showed high reliability, as indicated by a median estimate of 0.01 (89% CI [0.001, 0.039]). There were individual differences in how CS influences UCS, with a median estimate of 0.29 (89% CI [0.26, 0.32]). There was moderate unexplained variability in UCS, with a median estimate of 0.39 (89% CI [0.38, 0.41]).
These results highlight the complex interplay between compassionate and uncompassionate self-responding, as well as the robust individual differences and minimal daily fluctuations in these components. The findings provide strong support for the BCH. The consistent negative relationship between CS and UCS, alongside the observed impacts of negative affect and decentering, underscores the validity of the BCH across different contexts and individual differences. 
These conclusions align with those from Study 1, reinforcing the inverse relationship between compassionate and uncompassionate self-responding as proposed by the BCH. The robust negative correlation between CS and UCS, even when accounting for momentary NegAff and other contextual factors, emphasizes the dynamic interplay between these components of state self-compassion. This supports the idea that self-compassion operates as a bipolar construct rather than as independent or synergistic elements. The observed individual differences and stable relationships across various contexts further substantiate the BCH, highlighting its applicability and relevance in understanding self-compassion dynamics.
