Decentering, a mindfulness process allowing non-judgmental observation of thoughts and emotions, was explored as a novel dimension to test the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis [@bennett2021decentering; @bernstein2015decentering]. Decentering may strengthen CS by enabling greater kindness toward negative emotions and simultaneously reduce UCS. Study 2 included four additional items adapted from prior EMA research to measure decentering abilities, providing deeper insight into how mindfulness processes influence self-compassion components.

While decentering fosters detachment from negative thoughts and feelings, allowing space for self-compassion, it also potentially reshapes stress processing by framing emotions as transient rather than reflective of personal identity. This dual effect suggests that decentering and self-compassion are interrelated, each contributing to psychological resilience. Mindfulness connects these constructs, encouraging both non-judgmental observation (decentering) and greater self-kindness (self-compassion), ultimately promoting well-being.

**Statistical Model Specification.**  
To investigate the interaction between decentering and CS in predicting UCS, the following Bayesian multivariate model was used:

```r
model_interaction <- brm(
  bf(UCS ~ dec * CS + (1 + CS | user_id)) +
    bf(CS ~ dec + (1 | user_id)),
  data = d1,
  family = student(),
  chains = 4,
  cores = 8,
  threads = threading(2),
  backend = "cmdstanr",
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95, max_treedepth = 12)
)
```

This model included random slopes for CS at the user level, reflecting variability in the CS-UCS relationship across participants, and controlled for decentering as a fixed effect. A Studentâ€™s t-distribution was employed to account for outliers.
