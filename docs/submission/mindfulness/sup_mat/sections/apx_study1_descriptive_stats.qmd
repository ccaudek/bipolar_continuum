To rule out the possibility of emotional disorders or psychological conditions, we administered a series of validated psychological assessment questionnaires.

**Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21).**  
The DASS-21 [@Lovibond1995] is a 21-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess symptoms of depression (*e.g.*, “I felt down-hearted and blue”), anxiety (*e.g.*, “I felt I was close to panic”), and stress (*e.g.*, “I found it difficult to relax”) over the past week. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (*Did not apply to me at all*) to 3 (*Applied to me very much, or most of the time*). Both the original and Italian versions [@bottesi2015] demonstrate strong psychometric properties, including adequate reliability and validity.

**Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES).**  
The RSES [@Rosenberg1965] evaluates individual self-esteem levels using a 10-item scale (*e.g.*, "I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal basis with others"). Respondents rate each statement on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 (*Strongly Disagree*) to 4 (*Strongly Agree*), with higher scores indicating greater self-esteem. The scale has been widely validated and demonstrates strong reliability in both its original and translated versions.

**Self-Compassion Scale (SCS).**  
The SCS [@neff2003development] is a 26-item self-report measure designed to assess self-compassion in daily life. The SCS comprises six subscales: Self-Kindness, Common Humanity, Mindfulness, Self-Judgment, Isolation, and Over-Identification. Participants rate the frequency of self-compassionate behaviors on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (*Almost Never*) to 5 (*Almost Always*). Negative items are reverse-coded, and higher scores indicate greater self-compassion. The SCS demonstrates excellent psychometric properties, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.96 for the total score in the original validation study [@neff2003development]. Test-retest reliability is also strong, with a total score correlation of $r = 0.93$, and subscale correlations ranging from $r = 0.80$ to $r = 0.88$.

**Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS).**  
The DERS [@gratz2004difficulties] is a 36-item self-report measure designed to assess challenges in emotion regulation. It includes six subscales: Nonacceptance of Emotional Responses (NER), Difficulties Engaging in Goal-Directed Behavior (DEGB), Impulse Control Difficulties (ICD), Lack of Emotional Awareness (LEA), Limited Access to Emotion Regulation Strategies (LAERS), and Lack of Emotional Clarity (LEC). Respondents rate items on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (*Almost Never*) to 4 (*Almost Always*), with higher scores indicating greater difficulties in emotion regulation. Both the original scale and its Italian adaptation [@sighinolfi2010difficulties] have shown robust psychometric properties, including strong reliability and validity.

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics for all administered measures are presented below, including the estimated posterior mean, standard error, and 95% credibility intervals computed using a Bayesian model. Bayesian modeling was employed to accommodate deviations from Gaussianity and provide robust parameter estimates.
