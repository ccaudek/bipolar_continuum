To ensure that the model parameters accurately reflected participants' behavior in our task, we conducted posterior predictive checks, which were adequate for all examined models.

To confirm satisfactory convergence of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure for parameter estimation, we employed the convergence statistic $\hat{R}$ and monitored the number of divergent transitions during sampling. We verified that all population-level parameters had $\hat{R} < 1.01$. Additionally, posterior sampling of the models did not result in any divergent transitions.
