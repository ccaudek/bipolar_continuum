To estimate the multilevel correlation between the components of state self-compassion (CS and UCS), we fitted a Bayesian multilevel model using the `brms` package. The model accounts for the nested structure of the data (measurements nested within days, and days nested within participants). This approach ensures that both within- and between-person variability in the relationship between CS and UCS are accurately modeled.

### Model Specification

The model was specified as follows:

```r
f_joint <- brm(
  data = d1,
  family = student,
  bf(
    mvbind(SC, USC) ~ 1 + # Include intercepts for both components
      (1 | user_id) + # Random intercept for participants
      (1 | user_id:day) + # Random intercept for days within participants
      (1 | user_id:day:time_window) # Random intercept for time windows within days
  ) +
    set_rescor(TRUE), # Estimate residual correlations
  iter = 8000, # Total iterations
  warmup = 2000, # Warmup iterations
  chains = 4, # Number of chains
  cores = 8, # Number of cores for parallel computation
  seed = 210191, # Seed for reproducibility
  backend = "cmdstanr" # Backend for faster computations
)
```

### Extracting Residual Correlations

The residual correlation between CS and UCS at the momentary level was extracted from the posterior draws using the following function:

```r
extract_overall_correlation <- function(model) {
  draws <- as_draws_df(model)
  rescor_cols <- grep("^rescor__SC__USC", names(draws), value = TRUE)
  rescor_samples <- draws[[rescor_cols]]
  overall_correlation <- median(rescor_samples, na.rm = TRUE)
  ci_lower <- quantile(rescor_samples, 0.055, na.rm = TRUE)
  ci_upper <- quantile(rescor_samples, 0.945, na.rm = TRUE)
  data.frame(
  correlation = overall_correlation, ci_lower = ci_lower, ci_upper = ci_upper
  )
}
```

### Results

The overall within-person correlation between CS and UCS was estimated to be $r = -0.48$, with an 89% credible interval (CI) of $[-0.49, -0.47]$. This moderate negative correlation reflects the inverse relationship between CS and UCS at the state level, accounting for the nested data structure.

Additionally, the lagged correlation between state CS at a given time point and state UCS at the immediately preceding time point was weaker, estimated at $r = -0.10$ with an 89% CI of $[-0.12, -0.08]$. This highlights the temporal dynamics and suggests that immediate emotional and contextual factors influence the momentary relationship between CS and UCS.
