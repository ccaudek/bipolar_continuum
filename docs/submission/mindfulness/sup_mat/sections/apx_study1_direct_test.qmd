To directly test the BCH (rather than examining the separate effect of covariates on the CS and UCS, as in the two previous models), we employed a Bayesian hierarchical model in which UCS was the linear predictor of CS. This model also incorporated covariates such as within-day centered negative affect and context evaluation. Random effects were included to account for variability across participants, days, and measurements, which is crucial for capturing the inherent fluctuations in state self-compassion (see SI for details). The use of EMA data, enriched with relevant covariates, allowed for a thorough examination of the CS-UCS relationship under diverse conditions.

The predictive outcomes from this model directly tested the BCH. A credible negative fixed-effect slope for CS would validate the hypothesis, showing that increases in CS are associated with decreases in UCS, thus supporting the bipolar nature of state self-compassion. Conversely, a non-credible or positive fixed-effect slope for CS would challenge the BCH, suggesting that CS and UCS might function independently or even synergistically, rather than as opposing elements on a single continuum (Figure 1).

The central finding was a robust negative association between CS and UCS, with a median estimate of -0.44 (89% CI [-0.47, -0.42]). This result validates the BCH by demonstrating that higher levels of CS are associated with lower levels of UCS. 
After controlling for CS, negative affect showed a modest positive influence on UCS (β = 0.12, 89% CI [0.116, 0.13]), while the unpleasantness of the event had a minimal impact on UCS (β = 0.01, 89% CI [0.002, 0.02]). These findings indicate that contextual factors and negative affect play nuanced roles in shaping state self-compassion.
Substantial variability was observed in the random-effect slopes for CS across participants, with a median estimate of 0.29 (89% CI [0.26, 0.32]). This variability suggests substantial individual differences in how CS impacts UCS, reflecting the complex interplay between personality, context, and self-compassion.

Additionally, the analysis highlighted notable variability in UCS levels among participants (β = 0.63, 89% CI [0.59, 0.67]), underscoring considerable individual differences in state self-compassion responses. UCS also exhibited day-to-day variability (β = 0.04, 89% CI [0.02, 0.06]), albeit to a lesser extent than individual variability. This emphasizes the influence of daily emotional states and contextual stressors on self-compassion levels, reinforcing the state-dependent nature of self-compassion. Finally, the model reported minimal measurement error (median estimate: 0.01, 89% CI [0.001, 0.039]), attesting to the reliability of the assessment tools used.

In summary, the robust variability in UCS across participants and the credible random slope effects for CS indicate that the relationship between CS and UCS is influenced by a variety of factors. The moderate level of unexplained variability in UCS (median estimate: 0.41, 89% CI [0.40, 0.414]) suggests that additional factors, potentially outside the scope of this model, influence UCS levels. These factors may include unmeasured psychological variables such as personal beliefs, coping mechanisms, or external social support.
