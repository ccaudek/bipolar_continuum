In Study 2, we evaluated the impact of contextual variables on state self-compassion using two Bayesian hierarchical models, one for each dependent variable: UCS and CS. Both models incorporated fixed effects for negative affect, context, and decentering, each measured at the person, day, and moment levels, as well as random intercepts to account for variability across participants and days.

### brms Code

The final models were specified as follows, using the `brms` package:

```r
# Model for UCS
model_ucs <- brm(
  bf(usc ~ na_moment + na_day + na_person + 
         context_moment + context_day + context_person +
         dec_moment + dec_day + dec_person +
         (1 | user_id) + (1 | user_id:day),
     sigma ~ 1),
  data = dataset,
  family = student(),
  chains = 4,
  cores = 8,
  iter = 4000,
  warmup = 1000,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95, max_treedepth = 12),
  backend = "cmdstanr"
)

# Model for CS
model_cs <- brm(
  bf(cs ~ na_moment + na_day + na_person + 
         context_moment + context_day + context_person +
         dec_moment + dec_day + dec_person +
         (1 | user_id) + (1 | user_id:day),
     sigma ~ 1),
  data = dataset,
  family = student(),
  chains = 4,
  cores = 8,
  iter = 4000,
  warmup = 1000,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95, max_treedepth = 12),
  backend = "cmdstanr"
)
```
