We conducted a multilevel analysis to examine the correlations between the CS/UCS scores and each of the eight items of the augmented State Self-Compassion Scale [@neff2021development]. Participants were assessed multiple times across different moments and days, creating a nested data structure where measurements were clustered within individuals.

Multilevel correlations provide a more accurate estimate of the relationships between variables in hierarchical or clustered data compared to simple bivariate correlations. This approach accounts for the nested structure by separating within-person variation from between-person variation, leading to more precise estimates of the associations. In contrast, a simple bivariate correlation would not distinguish between these sources of variation, potentially conflating individual-level effects with population-level patterns and resulting in biased estimates.

To estimate multilevel correlations, we used a hierarchical linear model with random intercepts for participants, days, and time points. This model adjusts for the clustering of repeated measurements within individuals and provides separate estimates for correlations at the between-person and within-person levels.

### Results

The correlations between CS and UCS with the State Self-Compassion Scale items were substantial at both the between-person and within-person levels. Below, we report the between-person and within-person correlations for each item:

- **CS and Positive State Self-Compassion Items**:
  - **Self-Kindness**: Between-person $r = 0.94$, Within-person $r = 0.91$
  - **Self-Compassion**: Between-person $r = 0.88$, Within-person $r = 0.81$
  - **Mindfulness**: Between-person $r = 0.92$, Within-person $r = 0.84$
  - **Common Humanity**: Between-person $r = 0.93$, Within-person $r = 0.84$

- **UCS and Negative State Self-Compassion Items**:
  - **Self-Judgment**: Between-person $r = 0.88$, Within-person $r = 0.81$
  - **Isolation**: Between-person $r = 0.85$, Within-person $r = 0.79$
  - **Over-Identification**: Between-person $r = 0.89$, Within-person $r = 0.81$
  - **Over-Criticism**: Between-person $r = 0.92$, Within-person $r = 0.92$

The results show high correlations between CS and UCS across the subdimensions, suggesting substantial shared variance between these components of state self-compassion. Between-person correlations were slightly higher than within-person correlations, indicating that individual differences in CS and UCS are more stable across time than the moment-to-moment fluctuations.

In summary, the strong between-person correlations support the theoretical distinction between CS and UCS as interrelated components of self-compassion. In contrast, the slightly lower within-person correlations highlight the dynamic nature of self-compassion, emphasizing the importance of examining moment-to-moment fluctuations in response to daily life events. This dual perspective provides valuable insight into the stability and variability of state self-compassion.
