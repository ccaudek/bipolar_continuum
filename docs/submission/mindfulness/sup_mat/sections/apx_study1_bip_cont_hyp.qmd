One objective of this study was to test Hypothesis **H4**, examining the association between the CS and UCS components of state self-compassion within the multilevel structure of our EMA data. While the idionomic approach used in the manuscript provides a detailed individual-level analysis, this supplementary section presents a traditional nomothetic analysis to align with prior literature.

### Rationale  

Multilevel models are commonly used to address questions like H4, but they often assume psychological homogeneity and aggregate data toward group-level trends, potentially obscuring individual variability and temporal dynamics (Sahdra et al., 2024; Gelman, Hill, & Vehtari, 2020). To address these concerns, the manuscript used an idionomic approach combining data from both studies. However, for completeness, this section employs Bayesian hierarchical models separately for each study to assess the UCS-CS relationship under a nomothetic framework.

### Method  

The Bayesian hierarchical model predicted UCS from CS while including the following covariates: negative affect and context evaluation. Random intercepts at the participant, day, and measurement levels captured individual and temporal variability. The model also incorporated random slopes for CS to reflect individual differences in the UCS-CS relationship. Predictors were scaled to enable consistent interpretation, and a Student’s t-distribution was used for UCS to handle potential outliers.

The model’s fixed effects were tested to evaluate the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis. A credible negative slope for CS would support the hypothesis, indicating a bipolar relationship, while a positive or non-credible slope would challenge it.

### Results  

![The estimates are expressed in terms of inter-individual differences and intra-individual variations, both within a day and across different days. The bars represent 89% credibility intervals. $\beta_{CS}$ represents the beta coefficients for CS; $\beta_{\text{negative affect}}$ and $\beta_{\text{context valence}}$ denote the beta coefficients for negative affect and context valence, respectively; $\sigma_\text{measurement}$ is the standard deviation of the distribution of random effects coefficients for the 5 daily observations; $\sigma_\text{day}$ represents the standard deviation of the distribution of random effects coefficients across 10 days; $\sigma_\text{participant}$ indicates the standard deviation of the distribution of random effects coefficients across participants (subjects); $\sigma_\text{participant slope CS}$ is the standard deviation of the slopes describing the effect of CS on UCS for each participant; $\sigma_{UCS}$ is the estimated standard deviation of the population residuals distribution.](./sections/figures/plot_bch_piel.pdf)

The analysis revealed a robust negative association between CS and UCS, with a median slope of -0.44 (89% CI [-0.47, -0.42]), consistent with the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis.  

- **Covariates**: Negative affect positively influenced UCS ($\beta$ = 0.12, 89% CI [0.116, 0.13]), while context evaluation had minimal impact ($\beta$ = 0.01, 89% CI [0.002, 0.02]).  
- **Random Slopes**: The relationship between CS and UCS varied significantly across participants (median slope variability: 0.29, 89% CI [0.26, 0.32]), indicating substantial individual differences.  
- **Random Effects**: UCS levels showed considerable variability across participants ($\beta$ = 0.63, 89% CI [0.59, 0.67]) and moderate day-to-day fluctuations ($\beta$ = 0.04, 89% CI [0.02, 0.06]).  
- **Measurement Error**: Minimal error (median estimate: 0.01, 89% CI [0.001, 0.039]) demonstrated the reliability of the data.

These findings align with the Bipolar Continuum Hypothesis, showing that higher CS levels correspond to lower UCS levels. The variability in slopes highlights the complexity of the CS-UCS relationship, influenced by personality and contextual factors.


### Model Specification  

We implemented a hierarchical Bayesian model to account for participant-level, day-level, and measurement-level variability. The model included random effects and used the following prior distributions:

#### Priors

$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_{ucs} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 1), \\
\beta_{cs}, \beta_{covariates} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 1), \\
z_{participant}, z_{day}, z_{measurement}, z_{participant\_slope\_cs} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 1), \\
\sigma_{participant}, \sigma_{day}, \sigma_{measurement}, \sigma_{participant\_slope\_cs}, \sigma_{ucs} &\sim \text{Exponential}(1), \\
\nu &\sim \text{Gamma}(2, 0.1).
\end{aligned}
$$


#### Likelihood

The model assumes that the observed values of \( \text{UCS} \) follow a Student-\( t \) distribution. The parameters account for fixed effects (e.g., \( \alpha_{ucs} \), \( \beta_{cs} \)), random effects, and measurement error:

$$
\text{UCS}[n] \sim \text{Student-}t\left( \nu, \mu_n, \sigma_{ucs} \right),
$$

where:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_n = & \ \alpha_{ucs} \\
        & + \beta_{cs} \cdot \text{CS}[n] \\
        & + \beta_{neg\_affect} \cdot \text{neg\_affect}[n] \\
        & + \beta_{context\_eval} \cdot \text{context\_eval}[n] \\
        & + \sigma_{participant} \cdot z_{participant}[\text{participant}[n]] \\
        & + \sigma_{day} \cdot z_{day}[\text{day}[n]] \\
        & + \sigma_{measurement} \cdot z_{measurement}[\text{measurement}[n]] \\
        & + \sigma_{participant\_slope\_cs} \cdot z_{participant\_slope\_cs}[\text{participant}[n]].
\end{aligned}
$$
