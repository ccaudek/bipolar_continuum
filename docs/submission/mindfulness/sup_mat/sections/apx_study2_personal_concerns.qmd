This section details the script used to test the hypothesis that the correlation between the SC and USC components of state self-compassion is influenced by the level of personal concern. The same statistical model was applied to three distinct datasets, each representing different time points relative to an examination period:

1. **Pre-Exam Dataset**: Data collected one day before the exam.
2. **Post-Exam Dataset**: Data collected one day after the exam.
3. **Baseline Dataset**: Data collected during a period unrelated to any exam.

```r
bform <- 
  bf(mvbind(psc, nsc) ~ 1 + (1 | user_id)) +
  set_rescor(TRUE)

mod <- brm(
  bform,
  data = d,
  backend = "cmdstanr",
  chains = 4
)
```
