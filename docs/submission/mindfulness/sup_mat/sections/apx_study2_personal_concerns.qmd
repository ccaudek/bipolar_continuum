This section describes the statistical modeling approach used to test the hypothesis that the relationship between the CS and UCS components of state self-compassion varies depending on the level of personal concern, operationalized by proximity to an academic exam (**H3**). The analysis included data from three distinct time points:

1. **Pre-Exam Dataset**: Data collected one day before the exam.
2. **Post-Exam Dataset**: Data collected one day after the exam.
3. **Baseline Dataset**: Data collected during a period unrelated to any exam.

The model incorporated a multivariate response structure for CS and UCS, with random effects accounting for within- and between-subject variability across multiple time scales. The model specification was as follows:

```r
f_joint <- brm(
  data = alldata,
  family = student,
  bf(
    mvbind(SC, USC) ~ 0 + exam_day +
      (1 + exam_day | user_id) +
      (1 | user_id:day) +
      (1 | user_id:day:time_window),
    sigma ~ 0 + exam_day
  ) +
    set_rescor(TRUE),
  iter = 8000,
  warmup = 2000,
  chains = 4,
  cores = 8,
  seed = 210191,
  backend = "cmdstanr"
)
```

This model explicitly included fixed effects for the variable `exam_day`, reflecting the proximity to the exam (e.g., pre-exam, post-exam, or baseline), and allowed random slopes for `exam_day` at the participant level (`user_id`). Additional random intercepts were specified for `user_id:day` and `user_id:day:time_window`, capturing nested within-day and within-time-window variability. The residual correlation structure between CS and UCS was estimated using the `set_rescor(TRUE)` option, and heteroscedasticity was modeled through the inclusion of `sigma ~ 0 + exam_day`. 

The model was fit using the `cmdstanr` backend in `brms`, employing a robust Student's t-distribution for residuals to account for potential outliers. The sampling process utilized 4 chains, 8000 iterations (2000 warmup), and 8 cores, ensuring robust convergence diagnostics and precise parameter estimation.
