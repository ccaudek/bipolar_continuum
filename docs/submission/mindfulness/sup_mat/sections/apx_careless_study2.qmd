### Phase 1

#### Threshold

A total of 4 participants met the same criterion as in Study 1 and were excluded from subsequent EMA data collection.

### Phase 2

For the EMA data, we conducted additional checks on the repeated administrations of the 8-item State Self-Compassion Scale to ensure response quality at the individual level. The same procedure employed in Study 1 was applied. During the EMA phase, no participants met the previously defined criterion for careless responding. Consequently, all participants who adhered to the studyâ€™s response frequency requirements were included in the final statistical analyses.

### Integrating Metrics to Determine Careless Responding

```r
vectors <- list(mahad_bad, longstring_bad, irv_bad, even_odd_bad)

# Function to find shared elements across combinations
shared_counts <- map(2:4, ~ {
  combos <- combn(vectors, .x, simplify = FALSE)
  shared <- map(combos, ~ Reduce(intersect, .x)) %>% unlist() %>% unique()
  length(shared)
}) %>% set_names(paste0("shared_by_", 2:4))

# Output the results
shared_counts
# $shared_by_2
# [1] 4
# 
# $shared_by_3
# [1] 0
# 
# $shared_by_4
# [1] 0
