To ensure consistency and comparability with Study 1, we applied the same procedures to identify and exclude participants with inattentive or careless responding in Study 2.

### Compliance Rate

Participants with a compliance rate below 50% were excluded from the analysis, resulting in the exclusion of two participants.

### Time to Completion (TTC)

Following the approach used in Study 1, we applied the lower fence of the interquartile range (IQR) rule to identify participants with unusually short time-to-completion (TTC) values. No participants had TTC values below this threshold, suggesting no evidence of careless responding based on average response times.

### Careless Responding on the State Self-Compassion Scale

To assess inattentive responding, we calculated four indices—Longstring Index, Intra-Individual Response Variability (IRV), Even-Odd Inconsistency Index, and Mahalanobis Distance—based on responses to the State Self-Compassion Scale. Participants were flagged as potential careless responders if their scores exceeded the 95th percentile on any index. Participants flagged on more than two indices were classified as careless responders.

#### Integration of Metrics to Identify Careless Responding

To evaluate the overlap of flagged participants across indices, we used the following R script to calculate shared participants flagged by two, three, or four indices:

```r
vectors <- list(mahad_bad, longstring_bad, irv_bad, even_odd_bad)

# Identify shared flagged participants across combinations of indices
shared_counts <- map(2:4, ~ {
  combos <- combn(vectors, .x, simplify = FALSE)
  shared <- map(combos, ~ Reduce(intersect, .x)) %>% unlist() %>% unique()
  length(shared)
}) %>% set_names(paste0("shared_by_", 2:4))

# Output results
shared_counts
# $shared_by_2
# [1] 4
# 
# $shared_by_3
# [1] 0
# 
# $shared_by_4
# [1] 0
```

#### Final Assessment

No participants exceeded the threshold on more than two indices during the EMA phase of Study 2. Consequently, all participants who met the response frequency criterion were retained for the final statistical analyses.
