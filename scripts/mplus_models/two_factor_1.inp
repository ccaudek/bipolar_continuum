TITLE: Multilevel Two-Factor Model;

DATA: 
  FILE = "/Users/corrado/Documents/bipolar_continuum/data/mplus_data/neff.dat";

VARIABLE: 
  NAMES = user_id day time pos_1 neg_1 pos_2 neg_2 neg_3 pos_3 pos_4 neg_4;
  USEVARIABLES = pos_1 neg_1 pos_2 neg_2 neg_3 pos_3 pos_4 neg_4;
  CLUSTER = user_id;  ! Clustering at the subject level

MISSING = .;

ANALYSIS:
  TYPE = TWOLEVEL;  ! Multilevel model with user_id as the cluster
  ESTIMATOR = MLR;  ! Maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors

MODEL:
  %WITHIN%  ! Level 1: Variation within subjects
    Positive_w BY pos_1 pos_2 pos_3 pos_4;  ! First factor (positive items)
    Negative_w BY neg_1 neg_2 neg_3 neg_4;  ! Second factor (negative items)
    Positive_w WITH Negative_w;  ! Correlate the factors within subjects

  %BETWEEN%  ! Level 2: Between-subject variation
    Positive_b BY pos_1 pos_2 pos_3 pos_4;  ! First factor (positive items)
    Negative_b BY neg_1 neg_2 neg_3 neg_4;  ! Second factor (negative items)
    Positive_b WITH Negative_b;  ! Correlate the factors between subjects

OUTPUT:
  TECH1 TECH8 STANDARDIZED MODINDICES;
