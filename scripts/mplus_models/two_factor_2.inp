TITLE: Multilevel Two-Factor Model with Day and Occasion Clustering;

DATA: 
  FILE = "/Users/corrado/Documents/bipolar_continuum/data/mplus_data/neff.dat";

VARIABLE: 
  NAMES = user_id day occasion pos_1 neg_1 pos_2 neg_2 neg_3 pos_3 pos_4 neg_4;
  USEVARIABLES = pos_1 neg_1 pos_2 neg_2 neg_3 pos_3 pos_4 neg_4;
  CLUSTER = user_id day;  ! Clustering at participant and day levels

MISSING = .;

ANALYSIS:
  TYPE = THREELEVEL;  ! Multilevel model with three levels
  ESTIMATOR = MLR;    ! Maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors

MODEL:
  %WITHIN%  ! Level 1: Occasion-level variation (within days)
    PositiveCompassion_w BY pos_1 pos_2 pos_3 pos_4;
    NegativeCompassion_w BY neg_1 neg_2 neg_3 neg_4;
    PositiveCompassion_w WITH NegativeCompassion_w;  ! Correlated factors

  %BETWEEN day%  ! Level 2: Day-level variation (within participants)
    PositiveCompassion_d BY pos_1 pos_2 pos_3 pos_4;
    NegativeCompassion_d BY neg_1 neg_2 neg_3 neg_4;
    PositiveCompassion_d WITH NegativeCompassion_d;

  %BETWEEN user_id%  ! Level 3: Between-participant variation
    PositiveCompassion_b BY pos_1 pos_2 pos_3 pos_4;
    NegativeCompassion_b BY neg_1 neg_2 neg_3 neg_4;
    PositiveCompassion_b WITH NegativeCompassion_b;

OUTPUT:
